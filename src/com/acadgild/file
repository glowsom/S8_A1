Enrolling in the course of your choice is really easy.
Just enter your basic details, pick a payment plan, make
a payment, and you're all set to start.

Each course has a fixed number of hours and a pre-set
number of mentor meetings each week.

At this point you plunge into the practical aspects of
what you are learning and get hands-on experience through
working on projects.

You now have the skills, but you need to convince
prospective employers that you are perfect

This is when you see the fruits of your labor. You've done
a lot of hard work to complete the course and you even have
a project portfolio to show off.
